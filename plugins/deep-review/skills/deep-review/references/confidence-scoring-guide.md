# Confidence Scoring Guide

Rubric, thresholds, calibration rules, and examples for the Deep Review Critic-Agent.
Used by `critic-agent.md` to calibrate all findings from the 8 specialist agents.

---

## 1. Detection Method — Base Confidence

| Detection Method | Base Confidence Range | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Mechanical / Metric-based** | 85–95 | Empty catch body (AST count), LOC > threshold (line count), missing assert in test (AST), unreachable code after return |
| **AST Pattern Match** | 70–85 | String concat in SQL (pattern), hard-coded credential (regex + context), event listener without cleanup |
| **Cross-file / Taint trace** | 60–75 | SQL injection (source to sink across files), SSRF (user input to HTTP call across layers), circular dependency (import graph) |
| **Semantic / Heuristic** | 50–70 | God class responsibility analysis, deadlock from lock ordering inference, API contract change inference |

Start with the base confidence for the detection method, then apply adjustments below.

---

## 2. Confidence Adjustment Rules

| Condition | Adjustment |
|---|---|
| 2+ agents independently detected the same finding | +10 (cross-validation bonus) |
| Evidence snippet is ambiguous (could be safe or unsafe) | -15 |
| Reasoning chain has a logical gap or unsupported assumption | -20 |
| Finding relies on heuristic/semantic detection (not verifiable from code alone) | -10 |
| Referenced function/variable is private/internal (full call graph visible) | +5 |
| Referenced function is public API (external callers unknown) | -10 |
| Finding is in test, mock, or fixture file and pattern may be intentional | -25 |
| Framework or library known to mitigate this pattern (e.g., Django ORM handles SQLi) | -15 |
| Finding was confirmed by reading full function context (not just grep match) | +5 |

**Hard cap:** Maximum confidence = 95. Never assign 100 — static analysis always has uncertainty.

---

## 3. Threshold Rules

| Final Confidence | Action | Label in Report |
|---|---|---|
| 90–95 | Report | [CERTAIN] |
| 80–89 | Report | (no label) |
| 70–79 | Report | [REVIEW] — real but requires manual verification |
| 50–69 | Remove | Filtered out (too uncertain to report) |
| < 50 | Remove | Never reported |

**Filtering counts toward report statistics:**
```
Filtered out: 12 (false positives: 4, low confidence: 7, duplicates: 1)
```

---

## 4. Severity Calibration Matrix

Starting severity is set by the specialist agent. Adjust based on context:

| Context Modifier | Adjustment |
|---|---|
| Code is in test/ or dev/ directory only | -1 level (CRITICAL→HIGH, HIGH→MEDIUM, MEDIUM→LOW) |
| Code is guarded by feature flag (disabled in prod) | -1 level |
| Mitigating control exists elsewhere (WAF, input sanitizer, auth middleware) | -1 level, document in Critic Notes |
| Framework-level protection already active (Django CSRF middleware, SQLAlchemy parameterization) | Consider as false positive or -1 level |
| Issue is in a public-facing endpoint vs. internal-only service | +0 (public already HIGH or CRITICAL by default) |
| Issue is on a hot path (authenticated users can trigger easily) | No change — keep as-is |

**Severity scale:**
- CRITICAL: Directly exploitable, high impact, low difficulty (e.g., unauthenticated SQLi in login endpoint)
- HIGH: Exploitable with some conditions, significant impact
- MEDIUM: Exploitable with specific conditions, moderate impact or limited scope
- LOW: Defense-in-depth improvement, low direct impact

## 5. False Positive Rejection Catalog

The following patterns look like vulnerabilities but are SAFE — reject these findings:

### Security False Positives
1. **Parameterized SQL** — `cursor.execute("SELECT * WHERE id=%s", (user_id,))` — NOT SQLi
2. **ORM keyword args** — `User.objects.filter(name=username)` — NOT SQLi
3. **Placeholder credentials** — `password = "changeme"`, `API_KEY = "<YOUR_KEY>"`, `token = "example"` — NOT real credential
4. **Test file credentials** — any credential-like string in `/tests/`, `/test_`, `_test.py`, `_spec.js` — expected test fixtures
5. **Environment variable** — `os.environ["DB_PASSWORD"]` — NOT hard-coded
6. **textContent vs innerHTML** — `element.textContent = userInput` — NOT XSS (auto-encoded)
7. **safe_load** — `yaml.safe_load(data)` — NOT insecure deserialization
8. **subprocess with list** — `subprocess.run(["ls", path])` — NOT command injection
9. **SSTI with auto-escaping** — Jinja2 `autoescape=True` (default in Flask), Blade `{{ $var }}`, Twig auto-escaping — NOT SSTI (user input as data context, not template source)
10. **JWT with explicit algorithm** — `jwt.decode(token, key, algorithms=["HS256"])`, `.parseClaimsJws()`, `jwt.WithValidMethods()` — NOT JWT misuse
11. **Mass Assignment with allowlist** — Django `fields = ['name', 'email']`, Laravel `$fillable`, Rails `.permit()`, DTO classes — NOT mass assignment
12. **Secure XML parser** — Python `defusedxml`, Java `FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` + entity features disabled, `xml2js`/`fast-xml-parser` (pure JS), Go `encoding/xml`, PHP 8.0+ without LIBXML_NOENT — NOT XXE
13. **Non-security random** — `random.random()` for UI animations, display shuffling, game logic, test data — NOT insecure randomness (only flag when used for tokens, keys, session IDs, passwords)
14. **Structured logging with sanitization** — structlog, Pino with `redact` option, slog with `LogValuer`, Log4j2 JSON layout — NOT log injection
15. **Validated redirect** — `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme()`, `new URL()` + hostname allowlist, integer ID mapping — NOT open redirect
16. **Scoped private registry** — `.npmrc` with `@scope:registry=`, pip `--index-url` (single, no extra-index-url), `GOPRIVATE` set — NOT dependency confusion
17. **Separated LLM messages** — user input placed only in `user` role with proper system/user separation, input validation + output filtering implemented — NOT prompt injection

### Performance False Positives
18. **Pre-loaded queryset** — `users = User.objects.select_related('dept').all()` then loop — NOT N+1
19. **Fixed small collection** — nested loop over 2 lists with max 5 elements each — NOT O(n^2) concern
20. **join() for string building** — `", ".join(items)` in loop is O(n) — NOT string concat issue
21. **StringBuilder/join** — already using efficient builder pattern — NOT string concat issue
22. **Memoized component** — `React.memo` with stable props, `useMemo`/`useCallback` already applied — NOT missing memoization
23. **Indexed model field** — `db_index=True`, `index=True`, `@Index` already present on queried field — NOT missing index
24. **ESM or deep import** — `lodash-es`, `lodash/debounce`, direct file import bypassing barrel — NOT tree shaking killer
25. **Pre-loop serialization** — `JSON.stringify` called once before loop, result reused — NOT serialization waste
26. **Paginated or bounded query** — `.iterator()`, `.yield_per()`, `.limit()`, cursor pagination, or known-small table (enums, config) — NOT unbounded loading
27. **Reverse proxy compression** — nginx `gzip on`, Caddy auto-compress, CDN/Cloudflare handles compression — NOT missing compression middleware
28. **ReadOnly transaction set** — `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` already present, or method contains write operations — NOT inefficient transaction

### Concurrency False Positives
29. **Type-only import** — TypeScript `import type { X }` — NOT runtime circular dependency
30. **Immutable global** — `MAX_RETRIES = 3` at module level — NOT shared mutable state (it's a constant)
31. **Thread-local storage** — variable in `threading.local()` — NOT shared state
32. **Atomic read of primitive** — reading a bool flag set once at startup in Python (GIL-protected) — LOW risk
33. **Intentional permanent goroutine** — HTTP server listener, background worker with graceful shutdown via `signal.Notify` — NOT goroutine leak
34. **Void operator on promise** — `void asyncFunction()` is intentional fire-and-forget with explicit suppression — NOT floating promise
35. **Volatile singleton** — Java `volatile` on instance variable, Go `sync.Once`, C++11 magic statics, Python (GIL) — NOT unsafe DCL
36. **Dedicated executor** — `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(task, customExecutor)` or `Executors.newFixedThreadPool()` — NOT thread pool exhaustion
37. **setImmediate recursion** — `setImmediate()` runs in Check phase AFTER I/O poll, cannot starve I/O — NOT event loop starvation

### Resilience False Positives
38. **Top-level error boundary** — Express `app.use((err, req, res, next) => ...)` — correct catch-all location
39. **Flask global error handler** — `@app.errorhandler(Exception)` at application level — correct
40. **Main entry point** — `if __name__ == '__main__': try: main() except Exception: sys.exit(1)` — correct catch-all
41. **Optional operation** — `except Exception: pass` with clear comment: "Optional telemetry — safe to skip" — acceptable
42. **Internal service call** — Call to localhost, same-cluster service mesh, or local database — NOT missing circuit breaker (CB is for external/cross-network calls)
43. **Exponential backoff library** — `p-retry` (JS, exponential by default), tenacity `wait_exponential` already used, only 2 attempts — NOT retry without backoff
44. **Session-level timeout** — `requests.Session()` with timeout configured, `httpx` (5s default), client-level timeout set — NOT missing timeout
45. **Dependent promises** — Promises in sequence where result A is input for B, all-or-nothing transaction semantics — NOT partial failure (allSettled inappropriate)

### API Design False Positives
46. **Apollo Server v4 production** — Apollo Server v4 auto-disables introspection when `NODE_ENV=production`, graphql-armor already configured — NOT GraphQL anti-pattern
47. **API behind rate-limiting gateway** — Cloudflare, AWS API Gateway, nginx `limit_req_zone`, or WAF handles rate limiting at infrastructure level — NOT missing rate limiting
48. **Admin-only endpoint with RBAC** — Endpoint with proper authorization/role check (`@admin_required`, `IsAdminUser` permission class) before returning sensitive data — NOT sensitive data exposure
49. **FastAPI with Pydantic BaseModel** — Pydantic BaseModel type hints provide automatic schema validation, GraphQL schema types provide intrinsic validation — NOT missing request validation

### Testing False Positives
50. **assertDoesNotThrow** — test verifies no exception is thrown — this IS an assertion
51. **Mock.assert_called** or `verify()` on mock — counts as assertion
52. **Integration test accessing DB** — file in `integration/` or `e2e/` directory — expected external access
53. **pytest.raises** — tests that an exception IS raised — valid assertion
54. **test.each with conditional expected** — `test.each([[true, 'yes'], [false, 'no']])` with conditional expected values is parametrized testing — NOT conditional test logic
55. **Shared immutable const state** — `const CONFIG = Object.freeze({...})` or `final static` without mutation across tests — NOT test interdependency
56. **Correctly mocked non-deterministic source** — `jest.useFakeTimers()`, `jest.spyOn(Date, 'now')`, MSW configured, `@patch('requests.get')` — NOT flaky test pattern
57. **Small inline snapshot** — `toMatchInlineSnapshot()` <20 lines for API response shape or config object — NOT snapshot misuse

### Quality / Maintainability False Positives
58. **DTO/Mapper class accessing foreign data** — transformation is the class purpose, not feature envy. Mapper classes, serializers, formatters that exist to convert between representations legitimately access many foreign attributes.
59. **Constructor with DI dependencies** — many parameters justified by dependency injection pattern. Spring `@Autowired`, Guice `@Inject`, NestJS constructors with injected services are not a long parameter list smell.
60. **Test data setup repetition** — intentional explicit setup for test clarity per xUnit Patterns. Repeated fixture creation in test files is preferred over shared mutable state.
61. **Fluent API / Builder / Stream chain** — `builder.setA().setB().build()`, `stream.filter().map().collect()`, `Optional.map().flatMap().orElse()` — NOT message chain / Law of Demeter violation. Each method returns `this` or a new wrapper by design.

### Architecture False Positives
62. **Barrel file re-export** — `index.ts` that re-exports from multiple modules — NOT circular dependency
63. **Type import only** — TypeScript `import type { Foo }` from a module — no runtime cycle
64. **Configuration import** — `import constants from '../config'` is not a layer violation
65. **Same-layer import** — two services importing from each other's interface (not implementation) — acceptable coupling
66. **Project without explicit layer directories** — no `domain/`, `infrastructure/`, `core/`, `adapter/` directories recognizable — cannot determine DIP violation without recognized architecture structure → NOT dependency inversion violation
67. **Composition Root / DI Container** — the ONE place where concrete implementations are wired together (`main.py`, `container.ts`, `AppConfig.java`, `CompositionRoot`) — concrete dependencies are legitimately assembled here → NOT DIP violation
68. **DTO / Value Object / Event class** — class with only fields and accessors that is explicitly a data carrier by design, often immutable with constructor validation → NOT anemic domain model
69. **Config file or constants module** — dedicated config location (`settings.py`, `config.ts`, `application.yml`, `.env`, `constants.py`) with hardcoded values is correct pattern → NOT hardcoded configuration

## 6. Deduplication Rules

Merge findings when these conditions are met:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Same file:line AND same CWE | Merge — keep higher confidence, add `also_detected_by` |
| Same file AND same root cause AND adjacent lines (within 5 lines) | Merge — keep more specific finding |
| One finding is a symptom of another (e.g., resource leak AND missing finally) | Keep root cause finding, note symptom in remediation |
| Same pattern detected in 3+ locations in same file | Group into single finding with all locations listed |

**Merge format:**
```json
{
  "confidence": 92,
  "also_detected_by": ["performance-reviewer", "quality-reviewer"]
}
```

## 7. Calibration Examples

### Example 1 — Confidence Elevated by Cross-Validation
- security-reviewer finds SQL injection at `db.py:42`, confidence 82
- performance-reviewer also notes the raw query as evidence of N+1, confidence 75
- Cross-validation: same location, overlapping root cause
- Critic applies +10 cross-validation bonus to SQL injection finding
- Final confidence: 92 → CERTAIN, reported as CRITICAL

### Example 2 — Finding Filtered by Reasoning Gap
- concurrency-reviewer flags `counter += 1` in `app/config.py:15` as non-atomic increment, confidence 70
- Critic reads the code: `config.py` is loaded once at startup, `counter` is only written during initialization, never in request handling
- Applies -20 for reasoning gap (assumption of multi-thread access not supported)
- Also applies -10 for heuristic detection
- Final confidence: 40 → Below threshold, removed from report

### Example 3 — False Positive Rejected
- security-reviewer flags `db_password = os.environ['DB_PASSWORD']` at `settings.py:8` as hard-coded credential, confidence 75
- Critic identifies this is in the False Positive Rejection Catalog (item 5: environment variable reference)
- Finding rejected — not a real hard-coded credential
- Added to filtered count: false_positives + 1

### Example 4 — Severity Downgraded
- quality-reviewer finds God Class in `tests/helpers/test_utils.py` (test helper, 600 lines), confidence 88
- Critic checks: file is in tests/ directory
- Applies -1 severity level: HIGH → MEDIUM
- Notes in Critic Notes: "God class finding downgraded to MEDIUM — test helper file, not production code"

### Example 5 — REVIEW Label Applied
- resilience-reviewer finds swallowed exception in `background_tasks.py:88`, confidence 74
- Reasoning: exception is caught and logged, but task queue continues (may be intentional)
- Confidence 74 is in 70-79 range → report as [REVIEW]
- Labeled: `MEDIUM | Confidence: 74 [REVIEW]`
- Note: "Manual review recommended — exception handling in background task may be intentional"

### Example 6 — Cross-Agent Deduplication
- security-reviewer finds empty catch in `api/client.py:55` (CWE-1069), confidence 85
- resilience-reviewer finds same empty catch at `api/client.py:55` (CWE-1069), confidence 81
- Critic deduplicates: keep confidence 85 (higher), add `also_detected_by: ["resilience-reviewer"]`
- Apply cross-validation +10: final confidence 95 (capped)
- Report once with note: "Independently detected by 2 agents — high certainty"

## 8. Quality Gate Thresholds

| Gate | Conditions | Display |
|---|---|---|
| PASS | 0 CRITICAL findings | `[PASS] No critical findings. Ready for review.` |
| WARN — HIGH | 0 CRITICAL, 3+ HIGH findings | `[WARN — HIGH] N high severity findings. Review recommended before merge.` |
| FAIL — CRITICAL | 1+ CRITICAL findings | `[FAIL — CRITICAL] N critical finding(s) require remediation before merge.` |

The quality gate is informational, not blocking — it guides the developer's prioritization.
Final merge decision always rests with the human reviewer.
